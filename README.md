# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

An up and coming playwright, is attempting a fundraiser for her play *Fever*. Since Louise is new to Kickstarters, she is looking gather insight on past fundraisers in order to determine what a realistic goal shoud be when doing hers.

### Purpose

Using Excel, crowdfunding data will organized, sorted and analyzed to figure out any metrics that made past fundraisers successful. Louise can apply these ideas to her own Kickstarter, setting her up for success.

## Analysis and Challenges

### An analysis was performed on two catergories:

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The goal was to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful, "failed," and "canceled") versus launch date (month). This was accomplished using a pivot table. By adding filters for the parent category and year, the data could be quickly organized in ways that allowed Louise to be as specific or as general as neccessary. A line chart was derived from the pivot table, using months as the X-axis and outcomes as the Y-axis. The line chart summarized the pivot table and made it easier to quickly to compare the variables, as well as see trends:
